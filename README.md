Hi guys, we have a few interviews going in next week, and we thought with Joel it would be a good idea to give a task for candidates that we could discuss in the interview. We came up with the task and Gareth suggested we should validate it within the team first. We need 2-3 people to start doing the task for an hour, so we can see whether the instructions are clear and will be understood in the way we intend. Will stress it once again - we will not judge your code, you are not expected to finish the task, we just want you to start doing it, so we can see how the instructions are understood.

and here is the task:

You have been asked to write the business logic for an application that will support a Taxi Corporation.

The company hires drivers. Each driver can drive a different car on any given day
(the cars are owned by the company as well). Rides can be only booked using the app, by registered users.
The company also owns buses: these can be driven only by drivers with the appropriate license.

The business logic should make it possible to:
- list a driver's drives
- list a registered user's rides
- answer who was driving a specific car on a specific day
- validate whether a driver has the appropriate license to drive a specific vehicle

Additional info:
- please provide a .zip or Github repo with code
- you can take database into account if you want to
- UI is optional
- this task is meant to take no longer than 3hrs
- code doesn't have to run, we're interested in your approach
- using 3rd party tools is fine
- docs are optional

Please treat this task as an opportunity to show your skillset. We're not looking for a working application
but for the engineering aspect that will show the way you approach problems.
